# What this project is:

This project is meant to be a portfolio project and will eventually be listed on my [website](https://westonsublett.com). I started work on this project on October 26, 2021 in hopes to finish it in 6 months. 

This project is my take on a bug tracker similar to JIRA or the likes. I will be using technologies such as Spring, React Native, and MariaDB respectively. Most of these technologies will be fairly new to me so any advice is greatly appreciated!
